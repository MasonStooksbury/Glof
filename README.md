# Flog
An Angular implementation of the classic card game "Six Card Golf".  I named this "Flog" because the rules that we play with deviate so far from the original game that it almost seems backwards ("Flog" is a semordnilap of "Golf"). My wife and I play this game all the time, and this project helps us play wherever we are!
