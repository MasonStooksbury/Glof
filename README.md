# Flog
An Angular implementation of the classic card game "Six Card Golf".  I named this "Glof" because the rules that we play with deviate so far from the original game that it's really not even the same game, but slightly resembles it ("Glof" being an anagram of "Golf"). My wife and I play this game all the time, and this project helps us play wherever we are!
